The result of running the script is:

![Part3](Screenshot 2023-03-13 at 1.41.08 PM.png)

As you can see, the script went through all the steps and the changes appeared on my GitHub repo, changing `index1 += 1` on Line 43 to `index2 += 1`.

## Explanation of the script

## Steps 1-3

Steps 1-3 is done manually. I deleted the existing fork on my GitHub account and the existing `lab7` directory on my `ieng6` account. The repo can be found at [Lab 7](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7).
